An online mental health clinic is building a new board to allow its operations team to keep track of new bookings. They have a basic form to enter the member's details onto the board:

- Name
- Title
- Age
- Email
- Mobile Number

The board has 4 columns:

- **Unclaimed**: new cases
- **First Contact**: operations team contact member
- **Preparing Work Offer**: searching for Therapist
- **Send to Therapist**: matched with Therapist


This is a simple create-react-app application, and we are using ReactJS with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.
